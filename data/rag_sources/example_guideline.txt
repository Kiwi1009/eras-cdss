ERAS Clinical Decision Support - Example Guideline

===========================================
POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM (POD) ASSESSMENT
===========================================

1. RISK FACTORS
   - Age > 65 years
   - Pre-existing cognitive impairment
   - History of delirium
   - Severe illness (ASA score ≥ 3)
   - Prolonged surgery (> 2 hours)
   - Sleep disturbance
   - Sensory impairment

2. ASSESSMENT TOOLS
   
   Nu-DESC (Nursing Delirium Screening Scale):
   - Disorientation: 0-2 points
   - Inappropriate behavior: 0-2 points
   - Inappropriate communication: 0-2 points
   - Illusions/hallucinations: 0-2 points
   - Psychomotor retardation: 0-2 points
   - Total score: 0-10 (≥2 indicates delirium)

   CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for ICU):
   - Acute onset or fluctuating course
   - Inattention
   - Disorganized thinking
   - Altered level of consciousness

3. PREVENTION STRATEGIES
   - Early mobilization
   - Cognitive stimulation
   - Sleep protocol
   - Adequate pain control
   - Avoid deliriogenic medications
   - Maintain normal sleep-wake cycle
   - Provide orientation cues (clock, calendar)
   - Ensure hearing aids/glasses are available

4. MANAGEMENT
   - Non-pharmacological interventions first
   - Identify and treat underlying causes
   - Consider low-dose haloperidol if needed
   - Regular reassessment

===========================================
POSTOPERATIVE NAUSEA AND VOMITING (PONV)
===========================================

1. RISK FACTORS (Apfel Score)
   - Female gender: 1 point
   - Non-smoker: 1 point
   - History of PONV or motion sickness: 1 point
   - Postoperative opioid use: 1 point
   
   Risk levels:
   - 0-1 points: Low risk (10-20%)
   - 2 points: Moderate risk (40%)
   - 3-4 points: High risk (60-80%)

2. PROPHYLAXIS PROTOCOL
   
   Low risk (0-1 points):
   - No prophylaxis or single agent
   
   Moderate risk (2 points):
   - Single agent: dexamethasone 4-8 mg IV
   - Or: ondansetron 4 mg IV
   
   High risk (3-4 points):
   - Combination therapy:
     * Dexamethasone 4-8 mg IV (at induction)
     * Ondansetron 4 mg IV (at end of surgery)
     * Consider adding: droperidol 0.625-1.25 mg IV
                      or metoclopramide 10 mg IV

3. RESCUE THERAPY
   - If prophylaxis fails, use different class of antiemetic
   - Ondansetron 4 mg IV (if not used for prophylaxis)
   - Metoclopramide 10 mg IV
   - Promethazine 12.5-25 mg IV/IM

4. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
   - Avoid ondansetron in patients with QT prolongation
   - Dexamethasone contraindicated in uncontrolled diabetes
   - Consider scopolamine patch for high-risk patients

===========================================
CHEST TUBE MANAGEMENT
===========================================

1. INDICATIONS FOR REMOVAL
   - Drainage < 200 ml/24 hours (or < 2 ml/kg/24h)
   - No air leak for 24 hours
   - Good lung expansion on chest X-ray
   - Patient clinically stable
   - No active bleeding

2. REMOVAL PROCEDURE
   - Pre-medicate for pain if needed
   - Position patient (sitting or supine)
   - Remove sutures
   - Instruct patient to perform Valsalva maneuver
   - Quickly remove tube during expiration
   - Apply occlusive dressing
   - Monitor for complications

3. POST-REMOVAL MONITORING
   - Check for pneumothorax (chest X-ray if indicated)
   - Monitor respiratory status
   - Check dressing for drainage
   - Assess for subcutaneous emphysema

4. CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR REMOVAL
   - Active air leak
   - Drainage > 200 ml/24h
   - Incomplete lung expansion
   - Recent bleeding
   - Patient on positive pressure ventilation

5. COMPLICATIONS
   - Pneumothorax
   - Subcutaneous emphysema
   - Re-accumulation of fluid/air
   - Wound infection

===========================================
GENERAL ERAS PRINCIPLES
===========================================

1. PREOPERATIVE
   - Patient education
   - Prehabilitation when possible
   - Optimize comorbidities
   - Avoid prolonged fasting
   - Carbohydrate loading 2-4 hours before surgery

2. INTRAOPERATIVE
   - Minimally invasive techniques when possible
   - Goal-directed fluid therapy
   - Normothermia maintenance
   - Multimodal analgesia
   - Avoid excessive fluid administration

3. POSTOPERATIVE
   - Early mobilization (within 24 hours)
   - Early enteral nutrition
   - Multimodal pain management
   - Avoid unnecessary drains/tubes
   - Early removal of catheters
   - Regular assessment and protocol-driven care

4. OUTCOMES
   - Reduced length of stay
   - Lower complication rates
   - Improved patient satisfaction
   - Faster return to normal function
